## Troubleshooting

### The bot is online but not playing music

* **Check Lavalink**: Ensure your Lavalink server is active (default: `localhost:2333`).
* **Verify Credentials**: Double-check the Lavalink password in both `.env` and `application.yml`.
* **Check Permissions**: Ensure the bot has `Connect` and `Speak` permissions in your voice channel.

### Why is the music lagging or skipping?

Lag is typically caused by:

* Insufficient CPU/Memory on the host machine.
* Slow network connection between the bot and Lavalink or Lavalink and the audio source.
* Using an overloaded public Lavalink node. We highly recommend hosting your own node.

### "Permission Denied" errors

Ensure the bot has the following mandatory permissions:

* `View Channels`
* `Send Messages`
* `Embed Links`
* `Connect`
* `Speak`

## Configuration
